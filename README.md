# MovieDataAnalysis

Data Exploration:
We started by exploring the Netflix dataset, which provides information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix up to early 2022. Through preliminary analysis, we observed various features such as show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, and description.

Data Cleaning:
We faced several challenges with missing values, especially in the director and cast columns. We used data imputation methods to address these.

Genre Classification:
By using the description of the movies/TV shows, we trained a model to classify them into genres (listed_in). Although a basic attempt, this opened the discussion on the power of textual features in classification tasks and how Natural Language Processing can be harnessed.

Rating Prediction Based on Director:
We tried predicting the rating of movies based on the director. We faced some challenges given the high cardinality of the director feature and the difference in feature dimensions during training and prediction. Nonetheless, it highlighted the importance of dimensionality and feature consistency in machine learning tasks.

Recommendation System:
We discussed creating a basic recommendation system. The idea was to take a movie or TV show title as input and recommend similar titles based on features like description, director, cast, etc. This approach used similarity measures, emphasizing the vast applications of cosine similarity and TF-IDF in recommendation engines.

Duration Prediction:
We delved into a regression task where we tried predicting the duration of movies based on their description, director, and cast. Though a simple linear regression model was used, it showcased the potential of predicting quantitative features from a mix of textual and categorical data.

Concluding Interpretation:
The Netflix dataset, rich in textual and categorical features, offers a multitude of analysis and prediction opportunities. While our explorations were foundational, they underscore the importance of data preprocessing, the power of textual data, and the versatility of machine learning models. The challenges we encountered highlight the intricacies of real-world data science tasks, from dealing with missing values and high cardinality features to ensuring consistency in model input. The recommendation and prediction tasks we delved into are quintessential to the core operations of streaming platforms like Netflix. With more sophisticated models, feature engineering, and larger datasets, one can build robust systems that can significantly enhance user experience and business operations.
